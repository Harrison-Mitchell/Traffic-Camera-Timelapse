Create a timelapse of all traffic cameras provided from the RMS with views ranging from Pacific Highway to the Sydney Harbour Bridge

### Dependencies
* Python >= 3.5
* PIL (`pip install pillow`)

### Usage
Run `build.py` for as long as you desire. Then string the images together into a video with ffmpeg or a video editor or open source software such as ImagesToVideo.

### Example
3 hours from a Sunday morning (downscaled both in resolution and FPS so the GIF is under 2MB)
<div><img src="example.gif"></div><br>
